# BuildPulse Example Project: TestCafe

This is an example [TestCafe](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) project demonstrating how to send test results to [BuildPulse](https://buildpulse.io) to help you identify and eliminate flaky tests.

If you have an existing TestCafe project building on CircleCI, this [diff](https://github.com/Workshop64/buildpulse-example-testcafe/compare/d02eb13...circle-ci) shows how to set up your `.circleci/config.yml` to send test results to BuildPulse.
